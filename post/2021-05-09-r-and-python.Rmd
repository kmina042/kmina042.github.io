![Two very important languages!](/post/2021-05-09-r-and-python_files/randpython.jpg)

When it comes to coding, there's 2 major languages we need to know: R and python. But knowing one doesn't mean we can just ignore the other--it's best if we can interact with the two at once. This can be done through the reticulate package. Here we have two code chunk for each language.

R:

```{r}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

And now python!

```{python}
hw = "hello world"
hw[0:11]
```

Now that we've done a bit of each language, let's combine them with reticulate.

```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
matplotlib <- import("matplotlib")
matplotlib$use("Agg", force = TRUE)

hi<-"Welcome"
```

```{python}
#Python code chunk
hi="to reticulate!"
print(r.hi,hi) #access R-defined objects with r. 
```

```{R}
#R code chunk
cat(c(hi,py$hi)) #access Python-defined objects with py$

```


What if we want to plot some graphs?


```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas


x=np.random.normal(0,1,100) 
y=np.random.normal(0,1,100)

plt.scatter(x,y)
```

Here we can do a ggplot with R too.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()+geom_point(aes(py$x,py$y))
```
